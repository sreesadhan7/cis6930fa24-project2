GitHub Copilot | github.com | Assisted significantly in writing robust function docstrings and completing complex code structures, providing suggestions for efficient coding practices.
Python Standard Library | python.org | Utilized extensively for core functionalities such as file I/O operations, regular expressions (regex), and command-line argument parsing. Modules like sys, argparse, re, glob, and pathlib formed the backbone of the project's functionality.
spaCy | spacy.io | Used as the main natural language processing (NLP) tool to detect and classify named entities such as names, dates, locations, and organizations for the redaction process. spacy's pre-trained models (e.g., en_core_web_md) helped in the accurate detection of sensitive information.
pytest | pytest.org | Employed to create and run unit tests for the redaction functions. Pytest was used to ensure that various functionalities like censoring names, dates, phone numbers, addresses, and custom concepts worked as expected across multiple scenarios.
re (Regex Library) | docs.python.org/re | Extensively used for detecting sensitive information like phone numbers, email addresses, and custom patterns such as addresses. The regex library played a crucial role in pattern matching for data redaction, complementing the NLP-based redaction for structured information.
glob | docs.python.org/glob | Used for pattern matching to select multiple input files at once based on specified file patterns (e.g., *.txt). It made the redaction process more efficient by allowing batch processing of multiple files in a single run.
